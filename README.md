## :mag: Overview

**TL; DR.** We propose a plug-and-play **H**istory-**A**ware **T**ransformation algorithm for appearance features (*i.e.*, ReID features). **Guided by historical information, we seek a more discriminative subspace for target features** in video sequences, enabling **better differentiation between different trajectories**. Our method significantly enhances the reliability of appearance features, improving the performance of ReID-based MOT trackers.
